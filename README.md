# Mini-8: A simple 8-bit RISC-like CPU

This project implements a simple 8-bit CPU called Mini-8, which is designed to be easy to understand and use. The CPU has a small instruction set and is suitable for educational purposes or hobby projects.

See [ISA.md](ISA.md) for the CPU's instruction set architecture (ISA) details.

## Features
- 8-bit architecture
- Simple instruction set with basic arithmetic, logic, and control instructions
- Assembler for converting assembly code to machine code
- Support for labels and constants in assembly code
